Pomodoro Technique Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Technique timer implemented in [programming language]. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a simple yet effective way to improve your productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
